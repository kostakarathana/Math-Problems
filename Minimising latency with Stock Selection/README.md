# Minimise Latency with Stock Selection

## data: 

On a given day, find which company would have been the best buy through using minute-by-minute prices to determine the lowest point you could have bought with the highest point you could have sold. The rule is that you can only buy a stock once a day and sell it once. 

My goal is to build some sort of algorithm which can do this as quickly as possible. 

Here are the companies to search:
