# Math Problems

## What is this?

This is a repo where I just mess around with random things, not necessarily just math problems either. There's not much organisation to it, rather than just naming each mini-project. I like to see how I progress with my code, and it's cool to look back on some of my past coding! I don't do anything serious within these files, but rather tinker with random ideas/cool problems I see online.
