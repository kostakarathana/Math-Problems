# Math Problems

## What is this?

This is just a public repository where I tinker around with smaller projects or try and code solutions to settle arguments, find solutions to class problems, or really anything. It's fairly disorganised, I just like to keep a running record of my more random code. It's also encouraging to look at some of my past code and see how far I have come!
